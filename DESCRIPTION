Description: svaNUMT contains functions for detecting NUMT events from structural variant calls. 
    It takes structural variant calls in GRanges of breakend notation and identifies NUMTs by 
    nuclear-mitochondrial breakend junctions. The main function reports candidate NUMTs if there is a pair of valid insertion 
    sites found on the nuclear genome within a certain distance threshold.
    The candidate NUMTs are reported by events.
