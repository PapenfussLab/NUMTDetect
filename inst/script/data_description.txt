Data description:
1. MT.vcf is an example output of structural variant calls including breakends on the mitochondrial genome produced by GRIDSS*.
2. gridss-na12878.vcf is an example output of structural variant calls on chromosome 1 produced by GRIDSS*.
Both VCFs use hg19 as the reference genome.
3. chr1_numt_pe_HS25.sv.vcf is an output of structural variant calls produced by GRIDSS*. The input sample includes reads
of chromosome 1 simulated with a modified reference genome which contains randomly generated NUMT events. The simulated reads are
generated by ART(ART-MountRainier-2016-06-05)**.
